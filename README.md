# Mangos_are_acid
This tool is used to edit ACID Scripts to any MySQL database that you want to connect to, as long as it has the cmangos database installed.

## How to use:
There are several ways to use this. If you fork and clone this repository you will already have on the bin a Release version for use but I sugest you to compile the project on your machine and then run it.
